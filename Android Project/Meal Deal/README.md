**Design Pattern:**

I adopted MVC architecture on the client-side. However, in order to enhance the overall infrastructure, I used Singleton. For example, I choose Singleton Pattern to implement Fragment and Authentication.

**Roadblocks:**

**UI/UX:** The first challenge I encountered was Android's multi-screen size and ratio. There is a major drawback with importing the UI from Figma. The Android code generated by Figma is not sufficient to be implemented in the real application. 'Drawble' export doesn't fix the problem. I had to use default drawables to solve this problem.

**Firebase:** The next issue I faced was with Firebase authentication. At times, the application couldn’t fetch data from the real-time database. Moreover, in the upload product page on Chef’s end, I initially confronted a problem that displayed that the attempt of uploading the product to Firebase wasn’t successful, later on, I could solve this problem by changing the dependencies.

**Android Emulator**: Android emulator occupies a lot of memory space, and makes the device slower. After a certain amount of time, the emulator will display a 'System UI' dialog box to stop running. I had to spend several hours debugging my code and later I discovered that the error worked perfectly on the phone, but it was crashing on the emulator.
